A series of mathematicians -- including G\\''{o}del, Church, and Turing -- concerned themselves with this goal and showed it impossible to realize.  Many mathematical systems are <span class="underline">undecidable</span> [(undecidability]({{< relref "20201111222115-undecidability" >}})): there isn't an algorithm to decide the truth or falsity of statements made in them. Furthermore, many logical systems are <span class="underline">incomplete</span> ([Completeness]({{< relref "20201111222349-completeness" >}})): there are logical systems in which one cannot <span class="underline">prove</span> known truths in them.


### Definition of Computer {#definition-of-computer}

Involved in the task of defining computer were Turing, Church, Post, Kleene, von Neumann, and others.  Turing's approach was to assume basic representations for numbers, i.e., in terms of \\(1\\)'s and \\(0\\)'s, and describe performing basic operations on them.  The basic recipe looked something like the following:
