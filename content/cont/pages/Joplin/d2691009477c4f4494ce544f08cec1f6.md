# Starting with Rust


## 1. `Introduction`[^1]

Rust is a language developed by Mozilla Research.  It is a systems programming language, equalling C and C++ in its abilities.  It rivals idiomatic C++ in speed but lets you work in a safer way by forbidding code that could cause program crashes due to memory problems.  It's the only language that makes concurrent programming and parallel execution on multicore machines memory safe without garbage collection.  By design, Rust eliminates data races -- corruption of shared data through concurrent access.  

There seems to be an inverse relationship between control (e.g., of memory resources) and safety.  Rust overcomes this dilemma.  Rust lets yous specify how your values are laid out in memory and how that memory is managed.

To install Rust, type 
```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSF | sh 
```
and verify the version with `rustc -V`.
