## 1. `Introduction`[^1]

Powershell is an excellent acquisition engine for obtaining information from live systems, servers, peripherals, mobile devices, and data-driven applications like Active Directory.  

Here is the aim:

Powershell is a Microsoft framework that includes a command shell and a scripting language.  It's most typically used to automate administrative tasks and to examine the details of various devices, both local and remote, using the Common-Object-Model (COM) and Windows-Management-Interface (WMI).  It can now also be used to manage and examine remote Linux/Mac/etc devices using the Common Information Model (CIM).  


## 2. `CmdLets`

A CmdLet is a lightweight Windows Powershell script that performs a specific function.  CmdLets are expressed as a _verb-noun_ pair and have a help file that can be accessed with the verb-noun pair `Get-Help <CmdLet name> `.  The first Cmdlet to use is `Update-Help`.  Some key CmdLets are the following:
    - `Get-Help`
    - `Get-Process`
    - `Get-Member`

### `Get-Help`

Let's say we're interested in currently running services.  To find related CmdLets enter: 
```powershell
Get-Help services
```

Then select one or more of the returned CmdLets and `Get-Help` for them, for example `Get-Help Get-Service`.  Further information can be obtained with, e.g., `Get-Help Get-Service -Detailed` or `Get-Help Get-Service -Examples`.

### `Get-Process`
