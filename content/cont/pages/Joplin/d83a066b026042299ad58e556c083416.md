### 1. Basic Ideas

Experiment by writing small pieces of code -- e.g., in C or C++ -- then compile and examine assembly language output, which builds understanding of the relationship between the two.  A range of compilers is available at [godbolt](https://godbolt.org).

Another exercise: write small C programs and gradually rewrite in assembly, attempting to make the code as small as possible (even though modern compilers can produce highly optimized output).  

### 2. Optimization


Compilers typically have several levels of optimization (usually 3), with zero implying optimization is completely disabled.  Optimizations can be targeted towards code size or code speed.  Compilers can also produce debug information, which may include links between each line of source code and its respective machine code address.  If the compiler optimizes the code, there may be no such one-to-one mapping.
