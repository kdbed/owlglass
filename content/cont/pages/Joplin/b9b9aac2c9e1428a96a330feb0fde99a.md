# Ghidra


## 1. `Introduction`

Malware typically comes in two forms: native code (compiled) and interpreted code (runs through an interpreter).  The tools used then typically fall into two categories : those which do basic static and dynamic analysis (hashes, strings, sandboxes, etc.).  When moving to more advanced techniques, we see advanced static analysis using disassemblers and decompilers.  As examples, interpreted code (.NET binaries or Java binaries), one could use tools like dnSpy or JD project to output C#/Java from the byte code. For native code, one turns to tools like Ghidra, IDA Pro, or Binary Ninja to output disassembly/decompiler from the machine code.  Ghidra offers tools for analyzing compiled code.  Ghidra can perform assembly, disassembly, decompilation, graphing, and scripting.
