# Play It As It Lays 


## 0. `Introduction: David Thomson`

It may be the case that true evil has malice as a primary drive, whereas most people would be able -- through the process of self-justification -- be able to put up a defense (if, say, they were put on the stand).  In a great deal of modern fiction, the damage done in life is looked on as being tidal or climatic as much as the consequence of recklessness, selfishness, or some malign impulse in people like us. No-fault novel <----> blame-free divorce.  Evil or madness may be just aberrant chemicals; there is no causation or responsibility, nothing applies.
