# Background


## 1. `Host Discovery`[^1]
[^1]: Primary reference for this section: _Nmap: Network Exploration and Security Auditing_ - Paulino Calderon


NMap has a higher detection rate than the traditional ping utility as it sends more probes than simply the traditional ICMP echo requests.  To launch a ping scan against a network segment:
```
nmap -sn <target>

```
Ping scans can identify MAC addresses and vendors if conducted as a priviliged user on the local machine.  The option `-sn` disables port scanning.  The techniques involved are: sending a `TCP SYN` packet to port `443`, a `TCP ACK` packet to port 80, ICMP echo and timestamp requests if executed as a priviliged user (or `SYN` packets to 80,443 via `connect() syscall` if executed by a user who cannot send raw packets).  `ARP/Neighbor Discovery` is enabled when scanning local ethernet networks as a priviliged user, which is how MAC addresses and vendors are discovered.  

### Traceroute

Pingscans can include traceroute information 
```
nmap -sn --traceroute <target>
```
