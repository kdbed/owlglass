A monoidal category is a category equipped with extra data, allowing one to group objects and morphisms together to create bigger objects and morphisms.  One can think of objects in a category $A,B,C,...$  as _systems_ of a certain type, and morphisms $A \xrightarrow[]{f} B$ as _processes_ turning a system of type $A$ into a system type $B$. Examples:

- physical systems, and physical processes governing them
- data types in CS, and algorithms manipulating them
- algebraic or geometric structues in mathematics, and structure-preserving functions
- logical propositions, and proofs of implications between them


The extra structure implies we can consider processes in parallel, not just in sequence:
- physical systems evolving next to each other
- running computer algorithms in parallel
- taking products/sums of algebraic or geometric structures
- proving conjunctions of logical operations by proving both implications
