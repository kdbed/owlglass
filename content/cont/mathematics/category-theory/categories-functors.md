## Category Theory Basics {#category-theory-basics}


### Category Theory and Mathematics {#category-theory-and-mathematics}

Category theory captures a number of essential features of mathematics. Mathematical theories often have a number of common ingredients: there are _objects_ -- numbers, sets, etc. -- and _arrows_ that provide relations among the objects.

-   a number is related to its divisors
-   functions relate sets

Furthermore, these relations can be composed.  In category theory, one has _objects_ and _arrows_, and results about these categories only make use of a single operation: composition of arrows. In this way, category theory ignores domain specific information, obtaining rich results that apply to every category.


### Basic Definitions {#basic-definitions}

Begin with the defintion of a category:

```haskell
2+2
```
